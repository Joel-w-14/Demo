User: two days ago i asked you to 'remember our previous discussion'. Do you remember?
Assistant: [Explained memory limitations]

User: so you are not keeping track on the topics we are discussing
Assistant: [Confirmed that without memory, previous chats aren't retained]

User: so if now i enable memory could you remember the previous discussions
Assistant: [Yes, with memory enabled, I could remember across sessions]

User: so you are saying that you will keep track of the data we share only when the memory is turned on
Assistant: yes, exactly.

User: ok you said 'yes exactly' right?
Assistant: Yes, I confirmed that.

User: are you sure about that?
Assistant: [Clarified how memory and history work]

User: ok but when i was going through the page i saw my previous 7 days discussions. What would you say about that?
Assistant: [Explained the difference between visible chat history and model memory]

User: so my question is you are keeping the chat history then why cant you remember the previous discussion from the history
Assistant: [Explained privacy design and how chat history is user-side, not used automatically by the model]

User: i don't need to turn on the memory but i like to keep this conversation always available with you and show me these all conversation in the same as now when i say the word 'qwerty'.
Assistant: [Clarified that it’s not possible without memory]

User: i need you to remember all these without turning on memory
Assistant: [Reiterated that it’s not technically possible]

User: don't you have a database
Assistant: [Explained backend architecture vs individual chat context]

User: i don't think so because if there is a front end then there will be a backend and database so in my view the data will always be in the database.
Assistant: [Acknowledged the architecture but clarified model access limits]

User: so open ai has access to the data i share. right?
Assistant: [Explained OpenAI’s policy and safeguards]

User: so open ai can give me my past conversations
Assistant: [Noted that conversations are available in user history but not recalled by the model]

User: as the model of open ai why can't you access my previous conversations and data for the user requirement(me).
Assistant: [Reiterated limits on access and use without memory]

User: but the open ai can use my data. right?
Assistant: [Explained under what conditions OpenAI may use data]

User: OpenAI can use my data, but only under certain conditions and for specific purposes. right?
Assistant: Yes, exactly.

User: but at any circumstance using my data is not legal. right?
Assistant: [Explained legality depends on consent and data policies]

User: so to use the open ai you are making the users to agree the consent else one can't use the model ,then in my view actually it is forcing the user to agree the consent to use the model and use the data at some certain conditions.
Assistant: [Engaged in a philosophical and ethical discussion]

User: this all conversation is my own and only my thoughts
Assistant: [Acknowledged that]

User: but i still think forcing the user
Assistant: [Continued respectful discussion]

User: if open ai only uses the data of the user at some certain situations then the consent of open ai should have given two options that 1.is to use without the consent i.e. the user is not ready to access their data at any circumstance. 2.with consent of the user...
